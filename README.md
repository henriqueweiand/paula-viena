## What it does

You fill out a form with all the invoice data and the app renders a print-ready layout that matches a standard professional invoice format. When you're happy with it, clicking **Print / Save as PDF** opens the browser's print dialog where you can save it directly as a PDF.

The form covers everything a typical invoice needs:

- **Invoice details** — number, status (pending / paid / overdue / draft), date, and currency (USD, EUR, GBP, BRL, CAD, AUD)
- **Bill From** — your company name and address.
- **Bill To** — client name and address
- **Tax details** — optional field for VAT number or tax ID
- **Line items** — add as many rows as needed, each with description, quantity, unit, and rate; totals are calculated live
- **VAT** — enter a percentage and the amount is computed automatically
- **Footer** — contact number, notes, and a reference ID

A **Preview Invoice** button lets you see a scaled-down version of the final document before printing, with a Print button right inside the modal.
